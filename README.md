# mandelbrot-set

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how a mathematical algorithem, in this case fractals, can be mapped to an image file using simple I/O functionality of C++.

## 
**Mandelbrot generator outputs:**

### Ideas/Updates:
More complicated real time mapping(with scaling, zoom in/out, etc) can be implimented and I might work on updating the folders to do so in the future if time permits.
