# mandelbrot-set
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how a mathematical algorithem, in this case fractals, can be mapped into an image file using simple I/O functionality of C++. More complicated real time mapping can be implimented as well and I might work on updating the folders to do so in the future if time permits.
